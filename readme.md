Players may type and enter the number corresponding to the box in which they wish to place their marker. *The markers are "x" for Player One and "o" for player two.*

For example, to select the first box, the player simply needs to type '1' in the application and press enter.

After the player makes a valid selection the game board updates and input for the second player is now ready.

A player wins the game if they manage to get three markers in a row: horizontally, vertically, or horizontally.
